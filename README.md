# EyesAI

"Artificial Intelligence that serves as the eyes of the visually impaired."
Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

EyesAI is an envisioned project to build an Artificial Intelligence based application that can help blind people do normal tasks. EyesAI is planned to run with the help of computer vision, machine learning, speech recognition and other AI functions that can interact with users. 


## Background

* My idea will help visually impaired people beccome independent with the help of AI.
* My idea can be a way for visually impaired people to gain 'vision' of the world they live in.
* I am motivated to do this project because I want to help people who are visually impaired with the use of AI and related technologies.


## How is it used?

My project idea is simple. I aim to build a mobile application that implements computer vision, speech recognition, and a computer generated voice that interacts with the user. With the help of a camera, the app can assist a visually impaired person by acting as his/her eyes. The app can take any questions, orders, or instructions from a user as an input and processes it with the help of speech recognition, machine learning, and computer vision to help the user. 

## Data sources and AI methods

[CloudVision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision)

[Amazon Rekognition](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/)

[MS Image Processing API](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/computer-vision/)



## Challenges

*I will need to work with other people to implement my idea.
*The licensing part of the application might face oppositions since the well being of people is at stake if my program fails.
*Constant R&D and maintenance is needed to keep my app up and running.

I plan to solve these challenges by applying my full effort on implementing the idea. I shall make sure that my app is perfect in order to render a great service for my aimed customers.

## What next?

My project could grow trough investments and partnerships. I will use the financial aids of the said methods to further develop my program to have a better accuracy, faster performance and platform flexibility. If my project turns out to be a success, I could build more AI related programs that could contribute to the growth of the AI community.
